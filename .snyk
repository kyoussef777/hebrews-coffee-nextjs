        reason: >-
          This vulnerability is in a transitive dependency (inflight) only used in development 
          through sqlite3. The inflight package is unmaintained but the vulnerability requires 
          local access and only affects development builds. Production uses PostgreSQL without 
          this dependency chain. Risk is negligible for this coffee shop POS system.
